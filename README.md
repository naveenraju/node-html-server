node-html-server
================

This is an simple nodejs http server to serve static html or JSON files


Steps:

1. create a new directory
2. npm install serve-static --save ( this --save will save the entry in a package.json for  future installs)
3. create a new file (call it server.js).  and put the code as in here
4. npm install node-static --save
5. run `node server.js` -> This will start the serve and waits for http requests
6. Open the browser and hit http://localhost:8080

This will bring the static content from `public` folder.
